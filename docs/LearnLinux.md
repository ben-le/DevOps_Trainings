### Learn Linux

We are in an era where we cannot live without Linux/Unix systems. You should get a better understanding and working knowledge of various Linux distributions highly used by organizations (`RHEL`, `Centos`, `Ubuntu`, `CoreOS`, etc.).

As per The Linux Foundation case study, 90% of the public cloud workload runs on Linux.

#### Public Cloud Linux Usage

Here is another interesting study from Red Hat, which shows the different Linux distros used in the public cloud.

Now you have enough reasons why you should focus on Linux.

When it comes to Linux, itâ€™s all terminal; GUI is less preferred in *nix world. Get your hands dirty with the terminals of these systems.

You can use VirtualBox with Vagrant or AWS/GCP/Azure to spin up Linux servers.

### Getting Started

You can start with the following:

- Understand the Linux booting process
- Understand `systemd`
- Install and configure web servers (`Apache`, `Nginx`, `Tomcat`, etc.) and learn how web servers work.
- Learn how Linux processes work.
- Learn to set up HTTP proxies.
- Learn how `SSH` works.
- Learn about different file systems.
- Learn how volumes work in Linux.
- Learn about system logging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
- Learn about important protocols (`SSL`, `TLS`, `TCP`, `UDP`, `FTP`, `SFTP`, `SCP`, `SSH`).
- Learn to manage services and try to create a service on your own (`Initd`, `Systemd`).
- Host static/dynamic websites on web servers and play around with different configurations.
- Understand the difference between a Load Balancer and a Reverse Proxy.
- Set up Load Balancers and Reverse Proxy (`Nginx`, `HAProxy`, etc.). Understand each configuration and algorithm behind load balancing.
- Learn to optimize Linux performance.
- Set up a database and understand its configurations and management (e.g., PostgreSQL setup).
- Break something and learn to troubleshoot.

Tip: When working on real projects, you often work on Linux systems in a private network with limited access to public websites and resources. You need to have good knowledge of managing packages without internet connectivity.
