## Learn Container Orchestration and Distributed Systems

Distributed systems are the basic building blocks for modern scalable infrastructure. You need to understand the basic concepts of distributed systems because most tools that you use for microservices are distributed in nature. For example, Kubernetes.

Also, container adoption is increasing day by day. The organization you work for might not be using containers now. However, it is best to have hands-on knowledge of container technology like Docker or Podman. It will give you a competitive edge among your peers.

Once you understand Docker, you can start learning about the container orchestration tool Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is the new age Linux.

These platforms are best suited for microservices-based architecture.

Here is an interesting Kubernetes usage trend by Datadog.

Also, many engineers and even fresh college graduates are showing interest in learning Kubernetes. 2023 will see many engineers getting certified in Kubernetes. You can check out our CKA, CKAD, and CKS exam guides. You can pick the best Kubernetes certification based on the domain you want to work with.

Service mesh is an advanced topic in the container space. If you are a beginner to container toolsets, you can learn this after gaining a good amount of knowledge in container orchestration and microservices-based architecture. There are many service mesh tools from the CNCF foundation. You can take a look at the best service mesh tools for microservices.
