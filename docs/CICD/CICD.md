## Understanding the Flow: Demystifying the Application Delivery Lifecycle

The application delivery lifecycle (ADLC) is the heartbeat of modern software development. It encompasses the entire journey of your application, from conception to user hands. Here, three key concepts play a pivotal role:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Imagine a well-oiled assembly line. CI automates the integration of code changes from various developers, ensuring seamless merging and early detection of conflicts.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Building upon CI, CD automates the entire delivery pipeline. Code is automatically built, tested, and packaged, ready for deployment at any moment.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** This is where your application truly comes alive. CD automates the deployment process, pushing new versions to production environments swiftly and reliably.

### CI/CD Tools

Learn to use any of the following CI/CD tools:

| CI Tools          | CD Tools     |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Jenkins           | ArgoCD       |
| GitHub Actions    | FluxCD       |
| Drone CI          | Jenkins X    |
| Travis CI         | GoCD         |
