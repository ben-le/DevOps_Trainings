## Learn Git, GitOps & Learn to Document

It is essential to version control everything you do (except passwords and secrets :P). Git is the best version control tool. There are plenty of tutorials available on Git, and it will not take much time to learn important Git operations.

You can start with GitHub or Bitbucket as your remote code repository.

**Note:** Git branching strategy is an important aspect of any application release process.

Once you understand Git, learn about GitOps. It is an evolving technical practice not commonly used by companies. However, it will become a mainstream practice someday.

### What is GitOps?

GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud-native applications. It focuses on a developer-centric experience when operating infrastructure, by using tools developers are already familiar with, including Git and Continuous Deployment tools. You can read more on [gitops.tech](https://www.gitops.tech/).

ArgoCD is the widely used GitOps tool and you can get started with ArgoCD to learn GitOps practically.

### Document Everything

The next important thing is to document every important thing you do. Every repository must have a `README` file, which should explain your code in a clear and concise way. Good documentation will help not only you but also anyone who tries to use your code.
