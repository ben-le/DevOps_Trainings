### Understanding Load Balancer vs. Reverse Proxy

Both load balancers and reverse proxies are critical components in distributed and scalable web architectures. Hereâ€™s a concise explanation of their differences:

#### Load Balancer

1. **Purpose:**
   - Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers (or instances) to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, thereby improving reliability and scalability.

2. **Functionality:**
   - Acts as a traffic cop, directing client requests to the appropriate backend servers based on algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections, IP hashing).
   - Monitors server health (via health checks) and adjusts traffic distribution accordingly.
   - Provides high availability by automatically rerouting traffic away from failed or unhealthy servers.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Typically deployed at the network edge or in a dedicated tier (e.g., in front of application servers or microservices) to manage and balance incoming requests.

4. **Examples:**
   - Hardware Load Balancers: Physical devices dedicated to load balancing.
   - Software Load Balancers: Software-based solutions like NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ELB/ALB, Azure Load Balancer.

#### Reverse Proxy

1. **Purpose:**
   - Acts on behalf of backend servers (or services), intercepting client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate server.
   - Enhances security by hiding backend servers' IP addresses and exposing only the reverse proxy's IP address.

2. **Functionality:**
   - Receives client requests and forwards them to backend servers.
   - Can perform SSL termination, caching, compression, and other optimizations to improve performance.
   - Provides a single point of entry and security enforcement (e.g., filtering requests, protecting against DDoS attacks).

3. **Deployment:**
   - Typically deployed in front of web servers or application servers to handle incoming client requests and shield backend infrastructure.

4. **Examples:**
   - NGINX: Capable of both load balancing and reverse proxying.
   - Apache HTTP Server: Can function as a reverse proxy with modules like mod_proxy.
   - AWS CloudFront: A CDN service that acts as a reverse proxy for distributing content globally.

#### Summary

- **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance, reliability, and scalability.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers, enhancing security, performance, and manageability.

Understanding the roles and capabilities of both load balancers and reverse proxies is crucial for designing robust and efficient web architectures.
