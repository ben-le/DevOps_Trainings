### Learn Linux

We are in an era where we cannot live without Linux/Unix systems. You should get a better understanding and working knowledge of various Linux distributions highly used by organizations (`RHEL`, `Centos`, `Ubuntu`, `CoreOS`, etc.).

As per The Linux Foundation case study, 90% of the public cloud workload runs on Linux.

Here is another interesting study from Red Hat, which shows the different Linux distros used in the public cloud.

Now you have enough reasons why you should focus on Linux. When it comes to Linux, itâ€™s all terminal; GUI is less preferred in *nix world. Get your hands dirty with the terminals of these systems.
