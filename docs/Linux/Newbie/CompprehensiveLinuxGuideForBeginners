What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel. It is widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems due to its stability, security, and flexibility.

Brief history of Linux:
Origins: Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 while he was a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland. It was inspired by the MINIX operating system.

First Release: The first version, Linux 0.01, was released on September 17, 1991, and it was initially just a hobby project.

Open Source: Linus Torvalds released Linux under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1992, making it freely available and open source.

Growth: Throughout the 1990s, Linux rapidly gained popularity due to its stability, flexibility, and open-source nature, with contributions from developers worldwide.

Distributions: Various distributions (distros) emerged, such as Red Hat, Debian, and Slackware, each with different focuses and user bases.

Enterprise Use: By the early 2000s, Linux began to be adopted by major corporations and government organizations for servers and critical infrastructure.

Desktop Use: Although initially more popular on servers, user-friendly distros like Ubuntu, launched in 2004, boosted Linux's popularity on desktop computers.

Modern Era: Today, Linux is a dominant force in the server market, powers the majority of smartphones via Android, and is used in numerous embedded systems and supercomputers.

Community and Development: Linux continues to be developed collaboratively by a global community of developers, with the Linux Foundation supporting its growth and innovation.
