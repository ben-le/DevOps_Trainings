# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary to Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.

### Key Concepts

- **Collaboration:** DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes.
- **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks saves time and reduces human error.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** These practices ensure that code changes are automatically tested and deployed.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Continuously monitoring and logging to track system performance and issues.

### Benefits of DevOps

- **Speed:** Move at high velocity so you can innovate faster.
- **Rapid Delivery:** Increase the frequency and pace of releases.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes.
- **Scale:** Operate and manage infrastructure and development processes at scale.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model.
- **Security:** Maintain control and preserve compliance.
