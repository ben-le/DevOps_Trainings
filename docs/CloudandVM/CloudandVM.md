## Learn Cloud Computing & Virtualization

Cloud computing and virtualization are the basic building blocks of today’s DevOps practices.

You can start learning virtualization concepts using tools like VirtualBox & Vagrant (Type 2 virtualization). It is the foundation of cloud computing.

In terms of Cloud computing, you need to learn and get certified on cloud platforms.

When I say “Get Certified,” please do not use exam dumps to pass the certification. It adds significantly less value to you. It may be useful for the organization to show the clients that they have certified cloud engineers.

Most of the public cloud market share is currently owned by AWS. Here is the latest report from Statista.

Pick any one public cloud, preferably AWS, and learn about all its core infrastructure services. Do hands-on on all the core services and understand how they work.

Watch AWS re:Invent videos and understand how other organizations are using AWS services for hosting their applications.

Trust me, you will learn a lot from these videos, and no online training will provide that much information on how to run production workloads on AWS.

If you are planning to get certified in GCP, watch their Google Next videos.

Use the certification to gauge yourself on the respective platform.
