Layer 4 load balancers operate at the transport layer of the OSI model, which involves network protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Hereâ€™s how they typically work:

### Key Functions of Layer 4 Load Balancers:

1. **Traffic Direction Based on IPs and Ports:**
- Layer 4 load balancers route network traffic based on source and destination IP addresses and TCP or UDP port numbers. They make routing decisions quickly because they only need to read the header information in the data packets, without needing to look at the actual content of the packets.

2. **NAT (Network Address Translation):**
- As part of the routing process, Layer 4 load balancers often perform NAT. This involves rewriting the source or destination IP addresses of traffic as it passes through the load balancer. This capability ensures that the client maintains a continuous connection with the server, even if requests are handled by different servers behind the load balancer.

3. **Session Persistence:**
- Also known as sticky sessions, this function involves routing the requests from a specific client to the same server based on the session established during the initial request. This is important for applications where transactions or session data need to be maintained across multiple interactions.

4. **Load Distribution:**
- The load balancer distributes incoming service requests evenly across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed, improving the overall efficiency and reliability of the servers.

5. **Health Checks:**
- Regular health checks are performed to monitor the status of the servers. This helps the load balancer to avoid routing traffic to servers that are down or not responding properly.

### Advantages of Layer 4 Load Balancing:
- **Performance:** Since decisions are made based on information in the packet header, which requires less processing, Layer 4 load balancing can be performed very quickly.
- **Scalability:** It allows more connections to be handled simultaneously because the processing overhead is lower.
- **Simplicity:** The setup and management are generally simpler than those required for more complex deep packet inspections at higher layers.

### Limitations:
- **Lack of Granular Traffic Management:** Since it does not inspect the payload of the packets, Layer 4 load balancing cannot make decisions based on user-specific or complex application-specific data.
- **Limited Awareness:** It cannot detect issues that occur at the application layer, which might affect the performance or availability of backend services.

In summary, Layer 4 load balancers are efficient tools for managing large volumes of network traffic and ensuring that client requests are evenly distributed among available servers, enhancing the performance and reliability of applications.
