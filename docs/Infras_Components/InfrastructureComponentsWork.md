## Why Infrastructure Matters in DevOps

A strong foundation is crucial for any successful organization, and IT infrastructure is no different.  Whether it's housed in a traditional on-premise data center or leverages the cloud, understanding these core components is essential for anyone working in a DevOps environment.

## Benefits of Infrastructure Knowledge:

- **Effective Communication:** Participating in meetings with network/security teams becomes more productive. You can ask insightful questions, grasp their explanations, and collaborate more effectively.
- **Proactive Problem-Solving:** Imagine the difference between saying "It's not working, can you fix it?" and "I've done some troubleshooting, and based on my findings, here's what I suspect might be causing the issue. Could you take a look and help us diagnose further?". Understanding infrastructure allows for proactive problem-solving and faster resolution times.
