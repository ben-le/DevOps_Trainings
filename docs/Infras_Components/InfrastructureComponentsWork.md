## Learn How Infrastructure Components Work

The basic building block of any organization is its Infrastructure. It could be on the cloud or on-premise Data Center.

An overall understanding of Infrastructure components is a must for a person who wants to practice or work in a DevOps environment. For example, when you get into meetings with network/security teams, with a fair amount of infrastructure knowledge you can ask the right questions, understand what they are saying and collaborate better.

There is a big difference when you say “It’s not working, can you look into this” and “Hey, I have done my initial troubleshooting, and here are my findings. Can you look into this further and help us understand what’s causing the issue”

You should spend some time and have a basic understanding of the following:

### Networking
1. OSI Model/TCP-IP Model
2. Network Topologies
3. CIDR Notations
4. Subnetting
5. Public network
6. Private network
7. Static/Dynamic IPs
8. Firewall
9. Proxy
10. NAT
11. Public & Private DNS
12. VPN
13. IPv4 & IPv6 Protocols

### Storage
1. SAN
2. Backups
3. NFS
4. Object storage
5. Disk IOPS/throughput/latency
6. Databases
7. Key-Value Stores

### High Availability
1. Clusters
2. Fail-Over Mechanisms
3. Disaster Recovery
4. Vertical scaling
5. Horizontal scaling

### Single Sign-On
1. Active Directory/LDAP
2. SAML

### Security
1. SSL certificates
2. PKI Infrastructure
3. Zero trust security
4. Password/secret rotation
5. Security Compliance
6. Site-to-site VPN
7. Client-to-site VPN

### Load Balancers
1. L4 Load Balancers
2. L7 Load Balancers
3. Load balancing algorithms
4. Reverse Proxy

There are more things, but I have highlighted the critical components of an IT Infrastructure that you might encounter in your day-to-day job.
