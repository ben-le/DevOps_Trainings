# Storage: Databases

Databases are structured systems for storing, managing, and retrieving data. They play a crucial role in various applications, from websites to banking systems, by efficiently handling large amounts of data.

## Key Concepts

### Types of Databases

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**:
   - Organizes data into tables with predefined relationships between them.
   - Supports SQL for querying and managing data.
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

2. **NoSQL Databases**:
   - Designed for unstructured and semi-structured data with flexible schemas.
   - Types include key-value, document, column, and graph databases.
   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.

3. **In-Memory Databases**:
   - Stores data in memory instead of disk to provide faster response times and throughput.
   - Examples: Redis, Memcached.

4. **Distributed Databases**:
   - Spreads data across multiple physical locations, either within a single network or across multiple networks.
   - Examples: Cassandra, CockroachDB.

### Storage Models

1. **Disk Storage**:
   - Data is stored on magnetic disks, providing persistent storage at a lower cost.
   - Used by most traditional RDBMS and some NoSQL databases.

2. **In-Memory Storage**:
   - Data is stored in RAM, allowing faster access and processing.
   - Ideal for applications requiring rapid access to data, such as caching sessions and real-time analytics.

### ACID vs. BASE Properties

- **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)**:
  - Prioritizes reliability and correctness in transaction processing.
  - Common in traditional relational databases.

- **BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency)**:
  - Focuses on availability and partition tolerance.
  - More common in distributed and NoSQL databases.

## Advantages of Using Databases

1. **Data Management**:
   - Efficient management of data through indexing, querying, and transaction processing.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Ability to handle growth in data volume and user load.

3. **Security**:
   - Provides robust data security features like encryption and access controls.

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - Ensures accuracy and consistency of data through constraints and transactions.

## Disadvantages of Using Databases

1. **Complexity**:
   - Management and tuning of databases require specialized skills.

2. **Cost**:
   - Advanced features and scaling can be expensive, especially for large-scale deployments.

3. **Performance Challenges**:
   - High volumes of data and complex queries can lead to performance bottlenecks.

## Use Cases

1. **E-commerce Platforms**:
   - Use databases to manage inventory, user data, and transaction records.

2. **Financial Services**:
   - Handle transactions, accounts, and regulatory compliance data.

3. **Healthcare Systems**:
   - Manage patient records, scheduling, and medical data securely.
