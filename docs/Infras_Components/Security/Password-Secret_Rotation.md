# Password/Secret Rotation

Password or secret rotation refers to the practice of periodically changing passwords and other sensitive data (secrets) that are used to access secure systems, databases, or APIs. This security measure helps mitigate the risks of unauthorized access due to leaked, guessed, or stolen credentials.

## Key Concepts

### Importance of Rotation
- **Security Enhancement**: Regularly updating passwords and secrets limits the time window that compromised credentials can be used by unauthorized parties.
- **Compliance**: Many regulatory frameworks require periodic credential updates as part of their compliance measures.

### Rotation Policies
- **Automated Rotation**: Implementation of automated tools and processes that change passwords and secrets without human intervention.
- **Manual Rotation**: Requires administrators or users to manually update their credentials at set intervals.

## Benefits of Password/Secret Rotation

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Limits the duration that exposed credentials can be exploited, reducing the overall risk of breaches.
2. **Compliance Adherence**: Meets regulatory requirements that stipulate regular updates of sensitive credentials.
3. **Detection of Breaches**: Frequent updates can help in identifying and reacting to unauthorized access attempts when old credentials are used.

## Challenges of Rotation

1. **Operational Overhead**: Constant updating of credentials can require significant administrative effort, especially if not automated.
2. **Service Disruption**: Poorly managed rotation can lead to outages if updated credentials are not properly propagated through all systems.
3. **Complexity in Distributed Systems**: Coordinating updates across multiple systems and services can be complex and error-prone.

## Best Practices

1. **Automate the Rotation Process**: Use automated tools to change secrets and passwords, minimizing human error and reducing overhead.
2. **Integrate with Identity Management Systems**: Ensure that rotation policies are integrated with existing identity and access management systems.
3. **Monitor and Audit**: Continuously monitor access logs and audit credential usage to ensure that all changes are accounted for and no unauthorized access occurs.
