# Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery (DR) involves strategies and procedures to recover technology infrastructure and systems following a disaster, whether natural or human-induced. DR is a critical component of business continuity planning.

## Key Concepts

### Recovery Objectives

1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**:
   - The maximum targeted period in which data, applications, and systems must be restored after a disaster.

2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**:
   - The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time before the disaster occurs.

### Disaster Recovery Strategies

- **Data Backup**: Regular backups stored both on-site and off-site.
- **Replication**: Synchronous or asynchronous replication of data to a secondary site.
- **Failover**: Automatic switching to a redundant or standby system, server, or network.
- **Failback**: Returning operations to the primary location after they have been shifted to a secondary location during disaster recovery.

## Components of a Disaster Recovery Plan

1. **Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis**:
   - Identifies vulnerabilities and the potential impact of disasters on business operations.

2. **Disaster Recovery Sites**:
   - **Hot Site**: Fully operational and equipped site available immediately after the disaster.
   - **Cold Site**: A site where the necessary infrastructure and equipment are available but need setup and configuration.
   - **Warm Site**: A compromise between hot and cold, having equipment and connectivity that can be made operational quickly.

3. **Communication Plan**:
   - Details how communication should be handled internally and externally during and after a disaster.

4. **Testing and Maintenance**:
   - Regular testing of the DR plan to ensure its effectiveness and updates based on changes in the business.

## Advantages of Disaster Recovery

1. **Business Continuity**:
   - Minimizes downtime and ensures continuous operational capability.

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Protects data integrity by restoring systems and data to their pre-disaster state.

3. **Compliance**:
   - Helps comply with regulatory requirements that mandate disaster recovery plans.

## Disadvantages of Disaster Recovery

1. **Cost**:
   - Significant investment in disaster recovery sites, technology, and personnel.

2. **Complexity**:
   - Developing, implementing, and maintaining a DR plan can be complex and time-consuming.

3. **Resource Intensive**:
   - Requires dedicated resources for planning, testing, and execution.

## Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Objectives**:
   - Establish clear RTOs and RPOs based on business needs.

2. **Diversify Backup Locations**:
   - Use multiple locations to mitigate the risk of a single point of failure.

3. **Regular Updates and Testing**:
   - Frequently update and test the DR plan to ensure it evolves with the business.
