### OneLogin, Ping Identity, JumpCloud, Auth0, AWS Single Sign-On, and Google Cloud Identity
While the specific pros and cons for OneLogin, Ping Identity, JumpCloud, Auth0, AWS Single Sign-On, and Google Cloud Identity weren't detailed in the sources accessed, these platforms generally offer similar benefits and challenges as Azure AD and Okta.
