### What are the Best Programming and Scripting Languages for DevOps Engineers?

1. **GoLang**
   When it comes to DevOps, GoLang is my #1 choice.

   GoLang emerged from Google’s own open-source kitchen and has been revolutionizing the DevOps world since its inception in 2009. Its syntax, inspired by languages like Python and C++, makes it relatively easy for new programmers to pick up.

   Golang was developed for speed, emphasizing lean, network-efficient runtimes, which is crucial for DevOps.

   Many DevOps tools like Docker (containerization), Kubernetes (container orchestration), Juju (orchestration), and Terraform (Infrastructure as Code) are written in Golang due to its ability to compile standalone, static binaries for all major operating systems.

2. **Python**
   Python is a must-know scripting language for DevOps engineers.

   Python has become the most popular programming language for DevOps due to its simplicity, extensive library of modules, and readability. GitHub ranks it as the second-most popular programming language, and it’s the fastest-growing major language according to Stack Overflow.

   Python is ideal for automation with its concise syntax and interpreted nature, which provides faster execution compared to compiled languages like Java. It’s used extensively in infrastructure management (Puppet, Chef), automated testing (Selenium, WebDriver), and web development (Django, Flask).

   Python is widely adopted across organizations for infrastructure development, platform automation, and CI/CD utilities.

3. **Bash**
   Bash scripts (Linux Shell Scripting) are essential for various DevOps projects, including automated installations and configuration management.

   Bash is favored for its role in creating deployment scripts and managing Docker base images and CI/CD pipelines.

4. **Powershell**
   Powershell is indispensable for DevOps engineers working with Windows servers.

   Developed by Microsoft, Powershell is built on the .NET Framework and provides robust scripting capabilities for Windows system administration, app deployment, and infrastructure management. It also excels in data manipulation and analysis.

   Powershell scripts streamline server management tasks and support direct deployment on Windows servers.

5. **Groovy**
   Groovy, based on Java, is commonly used in Jenkins for writing Pipelines.

   Groovy scripting enables developers to automate software development tasks such as building files, compiling code, and running tests. It’s pivotal in Jenkins for creating pipelines as code and utilizing shared libraries.

6. **JavaScript**
   JavaScript is fundamental for both server-side and client-side implementations in web development.

   NodeJS, a server-side JavaScript runtime, supports backend APIs and command-line scripting, making it valuable for DevOps. JavaScript’s vast community and library support (Angular, React) ensure robust development and support for CI/CD tools like Jenkins CI and TravisCI.

### What is the Need for Programming in DevOps?

DevOps relies on programming and scripting skills for automating infrastructure, managing software deployments, and facilitating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). Programming knowledge is increasingly essential as infrastructure-as-code practices become standard.

### DevOps Programming FAQs

**Do you need to learn programming to become a DevOps engineer?**
While not all DevOps roles require programming skills, proficiency in scripting and automation is becoming more prevalent. Coding assessments are common in DevOps engineer interviews.

### Conclusion

The list of programming languages supporting DevOps is extensive, so choose wisely based on your project needs and career goals. As DevOps continues to evolve, programming skills will remain critical for success.

If your preferred language isn’t listed, it still has potential within DevOps—this field is diverse and adaptable to various technologies.
