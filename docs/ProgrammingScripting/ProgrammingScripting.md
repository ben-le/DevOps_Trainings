## Learn Programming & Scripting

Scripting is essential for a DevOps Engineer. Nowadays, for DevOps interviews, every decent company has a preliminary scripting/coding round.

Here is a snippet from the official Google Cloud blog which talks about skills to become a cloud engineer. It says, “Code is non-negotiable”.

In one way or another, you will end up using programs and scripts in the CI/CD workflow. You can learn the following commonly used scripting languages:

### Learning Programming

- **Bash/Shell**
- **Python**
- **Golang**

You can check out my following articles:

- [Shell Scripting for DevOps](link-to-shell-scripting-article)
- [Best Programming Languages for DevOps](link-to-best-programming-languages-article)
- [Python for DevOps](link-to-python-for-devops-article) – where I have explained different use cases of programming & scripting in DevOps.

To become a true DevOps engineer, you need to understand the developers’ world better. To do that, you need to know how a typical development process works. It is essential to have a good understanding of programming, APIs, etc. It will help you troubleshoot and collaborate better. Also, an understanding of APIs is a basic prerequisite to learning Kubernetes.

My suggestion is to pick a programming language and build an application from scratch. When I started my career, I built an entire Ruby on Rails web application from scratch even though development was not my primary work. This has helped me understand many concepts in the developer’s world. Even Google Cloud experts suggest the same.

When you develop an application, you will understand the process and components involved in application development. Once you know this, you can effectively interact with developers and have meaningful conversations.

In today’s world, we treat everything as code. Even though there are enough tools to automate everything, you might need custom functionality that a tool may not offer. In such cases, coding/scripting comes in handy to achieve those functionalities.

For example:
- Jenkins pipeline as code requires an understanding of Groovy.
- Ansible custom module requires an understanding of Python.
- Writing Kubernetes operator requires Golang experience.

If you look at AWS CDK or IaaC tools like Pulumi, you can use a programming language to define the infrastructure and do test-driven infrastructure development just like you develop applications.

Golang is really getting popular in the DevOps domain. Lots of DevOps tooling is done using Golang nowadays. In fact, tools like Kubernetes and Terraform are written in Go.

JFrog surveyed Golang adoption during GopherCon, and 18% of the respondents said they use Golang for DevOps-related work.

I have given enough reasons on why you should learn programming as a DevOps engineer.
