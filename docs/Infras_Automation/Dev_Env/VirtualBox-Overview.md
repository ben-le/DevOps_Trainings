# VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization software developed by Oracle. It is widely used for running multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine, making it an essential tool for developers, testers, and IT professionals.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform**: VirtualBox runs on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris, providing a consistent virtualization experience across different platforms.
- **Open Source**: VirtualBox is free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, allowing users to access and modify the source code.
- **Extensive Guest OS Support**: Supports a wide range of guest operating systems, including all versions of Windows, Linux distributions, macOS, and others.
- **Snapshots**: Allows users to save the state of a virtual machine at a specific point in time, making it easy to revert to a previous state if needed.
- **Seamless Mode**: Integrates guest applications with the host, allowing them to run side by side with native applications.
- **Shared Folders**: Enables sharing of files and folders between the host and guest operating systems, enhancing productivity and ease of use.
- **Virtual Networking**: Provides various networking options, including NAT, bridged networking, host-only networking, and internal networking, to suit different use cases.
- **Virtual Media Manager**: Manages virtual hard disks, CD/DVD-ROMs, and floppy disks, simplifying the organization and maintenance of virtual media.
