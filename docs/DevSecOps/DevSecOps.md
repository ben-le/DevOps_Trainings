## Learn Security Best Practices (DevSecOps)

DevSecOps is an area focused on integrating security practices into each stage of DevOps.

### What is DevSecOps?

According to Wikipedia:

> DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. The traditional centralized security team model must adopt a federated model allowing each delivery team the ability to factor in the correct security controls into their DevOps practices.

### Shift-Left Security

One of the key topics in DevSecOps is the Shift-left security approach. Shift-left security involves adopting security practices during the design and development stages.

The Cloud Security Alliance states:

> Security can be achieved only when it has been designed in. Applying security measures as an afterthought is a recipe for disaster.



In cloud environments, crypto mining is one of the common attacks. This often happens due to poorly maintained cloud access secrets, allowing hackers to gain access.


In DevOps, secret management for applications and infrastructure components should follow standard security practices. Consider reading about Zero trust security practices.
