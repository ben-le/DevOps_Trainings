## Logging, Monitoring, & Observability

Observability, logging, and monitoring are fundamental aspects of an infrastructure.

All apps deployed in the infrastructure will produce logs and metrics. Logs are pushed and stored in a logging infrastructure based on architecture and design.

Every company would have a logging and monitoring infrastructure. Commonly used logging stacks are Splunk and ELK. Additionally, there are SaaS companies like Loggly that provide logging infrastructure.

For monitoring, there are open-source tools like Prometheus and Nagios, as well as enterprise tools like AppDynamics, Datadog, SignalFx, etc. You can check out our blog on the best open-source monitoring tools.

Developers, operations teams, and security teams use logging systems to monitor, troubleshoot, and audit applications and infrastructure. Also, for AIOps, log data plays a key role.

In every organization, mission-critical applications are monitored 24/7 using monitoring dashboards. Generally, dashboards use data from logging sources or metrics generated by the application.

There would also be alerting systems that use the rules configured in the monitoring systems for alerting.

For example, an alert could be triggered as a Slack notification, Jira ticket, email alert, ServiceNow incident ticket, or xMatters phone call. Alerting workflows differ from organization to organization.

As a DevOps engineer, you should be able to query logs and troubleshoot issues in non-prod and prod environments. Understanding regular expressions is very important to query logs in any logging tool.
